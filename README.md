# SOARS-B

This repository contains the files that I used to conduct the molecular analyses associated with the SOARS-B phase 2 clinical trial of oxytocin in children with autism spectrum disorder (https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01944046). 

This project can be divided into three primary branches, which are reflected in the sub-directories of this repository
* Gene expression analyses (HT12 gene expression arrays)
* DNA methylation analyses (Targeted pyrosequencing, genome-wide 850K EPIC arrays)
* Genotype analyses (Omni 2.5 GWAS arrays, Taqman probes)
